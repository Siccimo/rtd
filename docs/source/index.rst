.. Image Classification Application Documentation

Introduction
=============

The Image Classification application is an integral part of the GIIADS platform, designed to streamline image classification tasks by providing users with a versatile and user-friendly environment. As a key component within the GIIADS platform, our Image Classification application simplifies the complexities associated with image classification tasks, offering users a flexible and empowering experience.

Key Components
---------------

The Image Classification application on the GIIADS platform is structured into three main components: Data Importation, Model, and Prediction.

1. **Data Importation:**
   Users can seamlessly import their data in the initial phase. This process offers two options: direct image uploads or utilizing an Excel file with image URLs.

2. **Model:**
   The Model component empowers users to tailor their experience by providing multiple options:
   - Construct a custom model from scratch.
   - Upload a pre-existing model.
   - Leverage one of the four available pretrained models.

3. **Prediction:**
   The Prediction component, although covered separately, is the final step in applying trained models to new data for predictions.

Project Structure
------------------

This concise project structure ensures a user-friendly and versatile environment for a diverse range of image classification tasks. The flexibility offered in data importation, model creation, and prediction makes the Image Classification application on the GIIADS platform an empowering tool for users with varied preferences.

Feel free to explore the detailed documentation for each component to maximize the benefits of the Image Classification application within the GIIADS platform.
